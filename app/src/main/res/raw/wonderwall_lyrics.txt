Today is gonna be the day That they're gonna throw it 
back to you By now you should've somehow Realized 
what you gotta do I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do, about you now
Back beat, the word  was 
on the street That the fire in your heart is out I'm sure you've heard it 
all before But you never really had a doubt
 I don't believe that anybody Feels the way I do about you now
.
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I Would like 
to say to you but I don't know how
Because maybe, 
you're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all, 
you're my wonderwall
